# Task-6

# Project Brief: Hosting a Static Website with GitHub Pages

# Objective:
To deploy a simple, static website using GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible over the internet.

# Overview:
GitHub Pages allows developers to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. Itâ€™s ideal for personal portfolios, documentation, project pages, or blogs without requiring any backend server.

# Key Steps:

Create a GitHub repository.

Add website files (index.html, CSS, JS, images).

Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings, choosing a branch and folder to publish from.

Access the live website via a GitHub-provided URL or a custom domain.

# Benefits:

Free hosting with global CDN.

Simple deployment by pushing to GitHub.

Supports custom domains.

Great for static sites with no server-side logic.

# Limitations:

Static content only (no backend code).

Repository and bandwidth limits apply.
