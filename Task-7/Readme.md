# Task 7: Monitor System Resources Using Netdata on your system :

# Project Overview: Monitor System Resources Using Netdata

I set up Netdata, a real time monitoring tool, to track and visualize system and application performance metrics. I deployed Netdata to monitor key resources like CPU, memory and disk usage, as well as the performance of Docker containers. I explored the interactive dashboard to analyze metrics, reviewed alerts, and checked logs to understand system behavior. This helped gain insights into system performance and identify potential issues efficiently.
